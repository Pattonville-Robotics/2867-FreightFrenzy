1. This exception about 1 second after INIT is pressed:

OpenCvCamera: java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to read from field 'double[] org.opencv.core.Scalar.val' on a null object reference

is caused by the Imgproc.rectangle call in CameraColorSensor.java:
            // draw debug data on the screen
            Mat output = input;
            for (DebugData data : debugList)
            {
                Imgproc.rectangle(output, data.upperLeft, data.lowerRight, data.color, data.width);
            }
I don't know why (probably data.color not initialized), but a try/catch around Imgproc.rectangle should stop it.

2. Region location/size: I changed RegionTopLeft[0] in my code to (0, 98) and it moved to the left side. So it should work in yours.

3. For safety, you should check for a valid region before checking the color, for example:
    public boolean isRegionBlue(int region) {
        boolean returnValue = false;
        List<EnumMap<Color_Enum, ColorData>> colorData = getColorData();

        if (region < colorData.size ()) {
            returnValue = (colorData.get(region).get(Color_Enum.Color_Blue).color == Color_Enum.Color_Blue);
        }
        return returnValue;
    }

LastResort.java is probably crashing (null pointer) because it instantiates a colorSensor. It can be deleted since it is not
used in this opmode.

12/6/21:

null pointer exception: Scalar - I think it is caused by starting before the camera has processed the first frame. It can be tested by
pressing Init and Start quickly and getting the error. Then press Init, wait a few seconds, then Start and no error.

To wait for first frame to be processed:
in CameraColorSensor.java: add this function right after the constructor:

    public boolean isCameraInitialized() {
        boolean returnValue = false;
        List<EnumMap<Color_Enum, ColorData>> colorData = getColorData();

        // after the first frame is processed, each region will have data
        if (colorData.size() >= NumRegions) {
            returnValue = true;
        }

        return (returnValue);
    }

Then in the opMode, add this before waitForStart:

        while (!colorSensor.isCameraInitialized()) {
            sleep(100);
        }
